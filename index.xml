      <description>it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years. since I started making my own lightmap baker.
and before I start this article, I finished this project. although I need a lot of things to do on it. such as optimization, complete some minor features and fix many bugs&amp;hellip;
but now I&amp;rsquo;m planning to make a Mark.II of it. because I judged here are too many things to be changed. also, I won&amp;rsquo;t use radiosity anymore.</description>

      <description>hello traveler! thank you for visiting my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m working on a game development industry.
so most of my posts will be related to programming stuff. particularly in rendering.
and since I&amp;rsquo;m not a good English speaker, some of(actually many of) articles will be awkward to read.
but I will try my best to write it makes sense. and always welcome to point out of a wrong explanation or suggest a better expression.</description>
