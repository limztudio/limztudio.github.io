      <description>About two years ago, I had a chance to migrate x86 based project to x64 project.
And there are not many works I had to do. Really. Because it was just a simple tool, so all I needed to do was switch the architecture of the platform, and fix some warnings come from different size of size_t.
It seems everything works fine, yet I found something works differently than before.</description>

      <description>A simple Sponza Palace baked by my first lightmap baker. Only one directional light and Skylight(ambient light) setup in the scene. Looking pretty rough. 
 And the lightmap of the whole scene above. It has an information of both direct light and indirect light colour.  
It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years. Since I started making my own lightmap baker.
And before I start this article, I finished this project.</description>

      <description>Hello traveler! Thank you for visiting my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m working on a game development industry.
So most of my posts will be related to programming stuff. Particularly in rendering.
And since I&amp;rsquo;m not a good English speaker, some of(actually many of) articles will be awkward to read.
But I will try my best to write it makes sense. And always welcome to point out of a wrong explanation or suggest a better expression.</description>
